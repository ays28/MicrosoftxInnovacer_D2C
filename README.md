Gentle Rhythm is an AI enabled sleep quality prediction system that can provide health intervention related suggestions such as: Being hydrated, Exercise, Taking rest, Good nutrition, etc. At the core of the system is a deep learning based AI that uses Actigraphy/Accelerometer based data data. This sensor based data provides details of user movement and can be used to detect motion or time of rest. This can further be used to determine quality of sleep. Once the model is trained, it can predict sleep quality from motion data and can inform user about necessary suggestion.
